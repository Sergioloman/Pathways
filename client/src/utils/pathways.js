// here we run the logic to chain each of the books

// each chapter is assigned an id when is created, the id is correspondent to the order of the story inside the book
// chapter 1 will be 1.a  which will be yield options to move towards 2a, 2.b , 2.c, 2,d ( think of it as levels in a [pyramid])
// chapter 2.b will connect to lvls 3.a 3b 3.c and so on.
// a visual layer will be necessary in order to make this possible. more to that later
// this being said. each pathway is a object? with a linear track of chapter 1.a into 2.c into 3.d etc stored in database
